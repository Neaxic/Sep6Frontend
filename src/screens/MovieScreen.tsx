              Chronicles the experiences of a formerly successful banker as a
              prisoner in the gloomy jailhouse of Shawshank after being found
              guilty of a crime he did not commit. The film portrays the man's
              unique way of dealing with his new, torturous life; along the way
              he befriends a number of fellow prisoners, most notably a wise
              long-term inmate named Red.â€”J-S-Golden
